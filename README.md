### Notes

It was difficult to connect the youtube videos to the app, but figured out that the way to do this is by creating a new youtube API key and parsing it to get the appropriate information.

   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
My app would keep crashing because of a false format statement. I learned the correct way to debug using debugger and also how to
parse an api and get relevant information. The process of getting the information and displaying in a certain format taught me a lot 
about how to connect the app to information from online api!
